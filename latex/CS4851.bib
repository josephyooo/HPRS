	abstract = {With increasing interest in hairstyles and hair color, bleaching, dyeing, straightening, and curling hair is being widely used worldwide, and the chemical and physical treatment of hair is also increasing. As a result, hair has suffered a lot of damage, and the degree of damage to hair has been measured only by the naked eye or touch. This has led to serious consequences, such as hair damage and scalp diseases. However, although these problems are serious, there is little research on hair damage. With the advancement of technology, people began to be interested in preventing and reversing hair damage. Manual observation methods cannot accurately and quickly identify hair damage areas. In recent years, with the rise of artificial intelligence technology, a large number of applications in various scenarios have given researchers new methods. In the project, we created a new hair damage data set based on SEM (scanning electron microscope) images. Through various physical and chemical analyses, we observe the changes in the hair surface according to the degree of hair damage, found the relationship between them, used a convolutional neural network to recognize and confirm the degree of hair damage, and categorized the degree of damage into weak damage, moderate damage and high damage.},

	abstract = {Almost 80 million Americans suffer from hair loss due to aging, stress, medication, or genetic makeup. Hair and scalp-related diseases often go unnoticed in the beginning. Sometimes, a patient cannot differentiate between hair loss and regular hair fall. Diagnosing hair-related diseases is time-consuming as it requires professional dermatologists to perform visual and medical tests. Because of that, the overall diagnosis gets delayed, which worsens the severity of the illness. Due to the image-processing ability, neural network-based applications are used in various sectors, especially healthcare and health informatics, to predict deadly diseases like cancers and tumors. These applications assist clinicians and patients and provide an initial insight into early-stage symptoms. In this study, we used a deep learning approach that successfully predicts three main types of hair loss and scalp-related diseases: alopecia, psoriasis, and folliculitis. However, limited study in this area, unavailability of a proper dataset, and degree of variety among the images scattered over the internet made the task challenging. 150 images were obtained from various sources and then preprocessed by denoising, image equalization, enhancement, and data balancing, thereby minimizing the error rate. After feeding the processed data into the 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we obtained overall training accuracy of 96.2\%, with a validation accuracy of 91.1\%. The precision and recall score of alopecia, psoriasis, and folliculitis are 0.895, 0.846, and 1.0, respectively. We also created a dataset of the scalp images for future prospective researchers.},

	abstract = {Many people suffer from scalp hair problems such as dandruff, folliculitis, hair loss, and oily hair due to poor daily habits, imbalanced nutritional intake, high stress, and toxic substances in their environment. To treat these scalp problems, dedicated services such as scalp hair physiotherapy have emerged in recent years. This article proposes a deep learning-based intelligent scalp inspection and diagnosis system, named ScalpEye, as an efficient inspection and diagnosis system for scalp hair physiotherapy as part of scalp healthcare. The proposed ScalpEye system consists of a portable scalp hair imaging microscope, a mobile device app, a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) training server, and a cloud-based management platform. The ScalpEye system can detect and diagnose four common scalp hair symptoms (dandruff, folliculitis, hair loss, and oily hair). In this study, we tested several popular object detection models and adopted a Faster R-CNN with the Inception ResNet\_v2\_Atrous model in the ScalpEye system for image recognition when inspecting and diagnosing scalp hair symptoms. The experimental results show that the ScalpEye system can diagnose four common scalp hair symptoms with an average precision (AP) ranging from 97.41\% to 99.09\%.},

	abstract = {The morbidity of scalp diseases is minuscule compared to other diseases, but the impact on the patient's life is enormous. It is common for people to experience scalp problems that include Dandruff, Psoriasis, Tinea-Capitis, Alopecia and Atopic-Dermatitis. In accordance with WHO research, approximately 70\% of adults have problems with their scalp. It has been demonstrated in descriptive research that hair quality is impaired by impaired scalp, but these impacts are reversible with early diagnosis and treatment. Deep Learning advances have demonstrated the effectiveness of CNN paired with FCN in diagnosing scalp and skin disorders. In one proposed Deep-Learning-based scalp inspection and diagnosis system, an imaging microscope and a trained model are combined with an app that classifies scalp disorders accurately with an average precision of 97.41\%- 99.09\%. Another research dealt with classifying the Psoriasis using the CNN with an accuracy of 82.9\%. As part of another study, an ML based algorithm was also employed. It accurately classified the healthy scalp and alopecia areata with 91.4\% and 88.9\% accuracy with SVM and KNN algorithms. Using deep learning models to diagnose scalp related diseases has improved due to advancements i computation capabilities and computer vision, but there remains a wide horizon for further improvements.},

	abstract = {Artificial neural networks are being used in many fields for different purposes. Medical diagnosis is one of the major purposes. In the field of medical, classification plays an important role as the main aim of the doctor is to classify whether a person is suffering from the disease or not. The objective of this paper is to evaluate neural network for the detection of alopecia in human beings and to find the accuracy. With the help of proposed model, the clinical experts will be able to get a second opinion that will help them to take proper decisions for diagnosing the presence of this disease in patients. This second opinion is crucial due to many factors while doing disease identification. These factors include increased population, environmental pollution, growing demands for proper medication, and less availability of medical experts to cope up with this increasing demand. Also, the dynamic nature of disease symptoms plays an important role in correct diagnosis of a certain disease. The proposed system uses a feedforward artificial neural network and backpropagation algorithm to classify patients with alopecia and without alopecia. The evaluation of the proposed system is done with the help of performance plot as well as regression plot. Experimental results show that the accuracy of proposed system is 91\% which is reliable enough for a clinical expert to make his decisions.},

This paper investigates deep learning methods for detecting hairs loss levels by men from face images. In this context, a specific training dataset has been prepared with face images having varied levels of baldness. Moreover, in spite of the low visibility of hairs in such images, a matching method is proposed for automatically classifying facial images with respect to pattern classification tables of male baldness from the medical area. Experimental results show the potential and the efficiency for medical, security and commercial applications.},

	abstract = {We present a simple, highly modularized network architecture for image classification. Our network is constructed by repeating a building block that aggregates a set of transformations with the same topology. Our simple design results in a homogeneous, multi-branch architecture that has only a few hyper-parameters to set. This strategy exposes a new dimension, which we call "cardinality" (the size of the set of transformations), as an essential factor in addition to the dimensions of depth and width. On the ImageNet-1K dataset, we empirically show that even under the restricted condition of maintaining complexity, increasing cardinality is able to improve classification accuracy. Moreover, increasing cardinality is more effective than going deeper or wider when we increase the capacity. Our models, named ResNeXt, are the foundations of our entry to the ILSVRC 2016 classification task in which we secured 2nd place. We further investigate ResNeXt on an ImageNet-5K set and the COCO detection set, also showing better results than its ResNet counterpart. The code and models are publicly available online.},
